# Card Games by Normandale Programming Club
This is the code for all of the Card Games we write. 
It is written all in java, written so that one program calls the card game choice,
then returns to that same game server so another choice can be made.

So far this set includes
 - Blackjack
 - Texas Hold-em
Planned
 - Poker
 - 3 Card Poker
